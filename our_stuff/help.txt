Hello fellow enemies!

To run your RL bot, I recommend creating two configuration for running playgame_rl.py, located in tools/ directory.
for training:
--nolaunch --rounds 100 -e --turns 1000 --map_file ../our_stuff/maps/tutorial1.map "python ../our_stuff/approxQ_bot/AQbot.py" "python sample_bots/python/LeftyBot.py"

for test:
-e --turns 100 --rounds 1 --map_file ../our_stuff/maps/tutorial1.map "python ../our_stuff/approxQ_bot/AQbot.py" "python sample_bots/python/HunterBot.py"

Don't forget to change approxQ_bot/AQbot.py to your copy.

Happy killing
